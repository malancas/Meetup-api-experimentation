# Experimenting with the Meetup API

### This is a small web app that uses the Meetup and Google Maps API to explore how the former API can be used to help meetup users find events when they are visiting cities on business trips or vacation

To quickstart, run the run.py file and direct your browser to https://localhost:5000/search

Enter the zipcode of the city you'll be visiting and the dates you will be available in the format yyyy-mm-dd

The app will then redirect to https://results to display a list of events happening in that area code during the dates enetered.

Dependency list: flask, flask-wtf
